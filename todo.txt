Bugs & todos

1. Single field rather than N into polyscope
2. Save values not field classes in polyscope
3. Use a bigint simple number type and write own rational ENumber
4. Fix weird relengthing bug in polyscope
5. Weird visualization bug of overriding in 102.
6. subdivision-based streamline tracing for 1-forms
7. 103 crashes on release
8. 1-form as Poisson disk sampling
9. fix curl_matching
10. Actually implement 201.
11. visualization bugs in 202.
12. enabled field and singularity indices as default.
13. set_field etc. naming conventions
14. 301 not compiling
15. 302 solve overriding visualization.
16. tune coefficients and allow for implicit normalization with a coefficient.
17. add a GL tutorial in chapter 3 (just smooth-and-normalize)
18. profile 303 to see why curl projection is so slow.
19. add interaction in 303.
20. 401 should allow choice of cycle.
21. 501 excessive printing and valence 2 warnings
22. 501 redundant mesh and wrong period of UV.
23. 502 enable sing + field together. Also still a valence 2 warning
24. Kill debug issues in 503 and relook at cut_mesh_with_singularities
25. 504 has z-fighting.
26. Shows boundary point as singular (is this ok?)
27. kill GMP in 505.
28. 601: vector lengths
29. 602: redundant printing
30. 602: rename functions to something coherent, make a more interesting tutorial.
31. 603: remove the recomputation of the harmonic basis, and instead save the result.
32. 603: rescale the quantities to be scalable.
33. 604: allow for Neumann and Dirichlet
34. 604: can we do several meshes?
35. 1-form visualization with poisson disc sampling
36. refactor setup_integration() and integrate() to use project_exact().
37. 605: perhaps add orthogonalization to an existing homology basis.
39. simplify and abstract calls.
40. Kill all printouts.
41. Document and clean all new files, remove obsolete files.
